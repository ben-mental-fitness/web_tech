 

Coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19)  
Situation Report – 121 

Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 20 May 2020 

Highlights 

WHO Regional Director for the Americas Dr Carissa F. Etienne highlighted that addressing 
COVID-19 will require protecting vulnerable groups including women, underprivileged 
populations, indigenous populations and migrants, by addressing health, social and economic 
inequalities.  

WHO has published a new Case Report Form for “Suspected cases of multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children and adolescents temporally related to COVID-19” 
intended for use by public health professionals for collecting standardized data on clinical 
presentations, severity and outcomes. 

Uganda commissioned the first Port Health COVID-19 laboratory at the main Uganda-
Tanzania border in light of potential COVID-19 importation by truck drivers. Two GeneXpert 
machines will be used to test all truck drivers arriving at the Mutukula point of entry, where 
results will become available within 45 minutes. 

A doctor from Cairo, Egypt describes how he became infected with and recovered from COVID-
19 and highlights the need for health care workers to practise basic infection, prevention and 
control measures when interacting with patients. 

Evidence from social science can help officials develop and implement policies in ways that are 
more likely to work because they are tailored to local needs. In the ‘Subject in Focus’ below, we 
look at how WHO is implementing the COVID-19 Research Roadmap agenda to translate 
evidence from the social sciences into action.

Subject in Focus: Infodemics Management - Social science 
evidence in outbreak response   

To  tackle  the  health,  social  and  economic  challenges  of  COVID-19,  decision-makers  need  data  and 
research from many different disciplines. At the Global Research and Innovation meeting held in Geneva 
on 11-12 February 2020, over 400 scientists, Member State representatives, public health professionals, 
donors and private sector representatives came together to agree on priorities to accelerate research for 
the  COVID-19  response.  Social  science  was  one  of  the  nine  research  areas  that  featured  on  the 
meeting’s agenda.   

Social science is a broad disciplinary field that includes anthropology, psychology, behavioural science, 
political science, and social epidemiology. Evidence from social science can help officials develop and 
implement policies in ways that are more likely to work because they are tailored to local needs and to 
the realities of where and how people live, think and act, as individuals and as a group.  
 
A technical working group of social scientists across  the world’s regions was convened to guide and 
support further development of the COVID-19 Research Roadmap agenda.1  The aim of this group is to 
translate evidence from the social sciences into action that can inform response strategies by developing 
and  sharing  protocols,  tools  and  technical  expertise,  for  example  on  key  considerations  from  social 
science on public use of face masks, immunity passports, homecare, routine immunization programmes, 
and vaccine implementation. The group achieves its objectives through collaboration and by coordinating 
action with other initiatives, including with the research arm of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response 
Network (GOARN).  
 
The COVID-19  Research  Roadmap highlighted  the need  for social  science  research  in  three  priority 
areas: 
 
First,  research  about  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  and  the  public  health  response,  including  secondary 
impacts,  will  help  countries  at  different  phases  of  the  response  to  learn  from  others.  This  is  key  to 
informing and tailoring local and national responses. For example, research on how public health lock-
down measures have affected mental health and household incomes can help officials plan how best to 
support  communities  once  these  measures  are  lifted.  Under  the  COVID-19  Research  Roadmap,  a 
research group in China is studying the lessons learned following the public health measures taken in 
that country.  
 
Second, research on health systems and models of care in different regions will enable adaptation and 
efficiencies specific to the COVID-19 health care response. Research in this area can help officials plan 
best approaches for managing patient flows and also provide the right support to those providing care in 
formal and informal community settings. A review of different models of homecare is currently underway 
to  identify  and  share  best  methods  for  low  resource  settings.  Working  with  infection  prevention  and 
control  experts,  a  research  protocol  guidance  document  and  data  collection  tools  have  also  been 
developed to study the views of health workers on infection prevention and control procedures and on 
their  well-being.  Research  groups  in  different  regions  are  implementing  this  study  and  are  meeting 
regularly to share experiences, results and learning.  
 
Third,  research  on  the  flows  of  information,  misinformation  and  disinformation,  and  on  effective 
approaches  for  addressing  stigma,  will  help  science-based  information  and  recommendations  reach 
intended audiences. Data-driven insights can help officials tackle the infodemic and implement strategies

to  build  trust.  Across  all  these  areas,  there  is  an  essential  need  to  define  and  prioritize  vulnerable 
populations so that evidence can inform policy development which accounts for and meets their needs.  
 
The working group continues to collaborate with colleagues working on different technical areas and 
groups: immunization, ethics, gender, maternal and child health, sexual and reproductive health, to name 
a few; informing social science evidence in the work of WHO.  
 
A  toolbox on good participatory  practice  for  COVID-19 clinical  trials  and  on  working with  Community 
Advisory Boards for COVID-19 related clinical studies is also now available.

Case definitions  
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus 
disease (COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.  

Definition of COVID-19 death 

COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically 
compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear 
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There 
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death. 

Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of 
death is available here. 
 

 

 

Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes 
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected 
between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other 
sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken 
to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. 
Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between 
countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented, 
with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting 
these data at global level.   

The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the 
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any 
country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or 
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which 
there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the 
administering WHO region. 

The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that 
they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that 
are not mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are 
distinguished by initial capital letters. 

[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations 
Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo 
(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes. 

Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case 
definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and 
errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases.  

Other*: includes cases reported from an international conveyance (Diamond Princess).  

Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove 
large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as 
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid 
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available 
that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be 
updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the 
most up-to-date data. 

Additional table notes 

i Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. 
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new information becomes 
available, and are based on the highest category reported. Differing degrees of transmission 
may be present within countries/territories/areas. Categories:  

•  No cases: with no confirmed cases (not shown in table). 
•  Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected. 
•  Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by 

common exposures. 

•  Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined 

through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not 
linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; 
and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area. 

•  Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.  

 
ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of 
similar status. 

Additional figure notes 

The decrease in cases shown today in Figure 2 should be interpreted with caution, as updated 
case counts are temporarily not available for several countries with large numbers of cases 
(see Table 1 for specifics).  

Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata 

•  Update 20 May 2020, United States of America: Counts adjusted retrospectively by 

national authorities due to data reclassification: 57 cases and one death were excluded. 
•  Update 20 May 2020, France: Counts adjusted retrospectively by national authorities due 

to data reclassification: 218 deaths were excluded.
