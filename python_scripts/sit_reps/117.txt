 

Coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19)  
Situation Report – 117 

Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 16 May 2020 
 

Highlights 

 
WHO has published a new scientific brief on “Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children 
and adolescents with COVID-19”, given the reported clusters of children and adolescents who 
require admission to intensive care units with a multisystem inflammatory condition. There is an 
urgent need for collecting standardized data describing epidemiology, clinical presentations, 
severity, and outcomes. 

WHO Director-General Dr Tedros, in his media briefing yesterday, highlighted the need to 
“unleash the full power of science, to deliver innovations that are scalable, usable, and benefit 
everyone, everywhere, at the same time”. 

WHO has published new guidance on “Cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces in 
the context of COVID-19”, intended for healthcare professionals, public health professionals and 
health authorities that are developing and implementing cleaning and disinfection policies and 
standard operating procedures. 

WHO and UNICEF have published a document on frequently asked questions (FAQs) about 
immunization in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. These FAQs accompany WHO’s 
Guiding principles for immunization activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Case definitions  
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus 
disease (COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.  

Definition of COVID-19 death 

COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically 
compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear 
alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There 
should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death. 

Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of 
death is available here. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes 
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected 
between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other 
sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken 
to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. 
Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between 
countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented, 
with variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting 
these data at global level.   

The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the 
expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any 
country, territory or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or 
boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which 
there may not yet be full agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the 
administering WHO region. 

[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations 
Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo 
(UNSCR 1244, 1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes. 

Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case 
definitions, unless stated otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and 
errata), and include both domestic and repatriated cases.  

Other*: includes cases reported from an international conveyance (Diamond Princess).  

Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove 
large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as 
negative numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid 
readers in identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available 
that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be 
updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the 
most up-to-date data. 

Additional table notes 

i Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. 
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new information becomes 
available, and are based on the highest category reported. Differing degrees of transmission 
may be present within countries/territories/areas. Categories:  

•  No cases: with no confirmed cases (not shown in table). 
•  Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected. 
•  Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by 

common exposures. 

•  Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined 

through an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not 
linkable to transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; 
and/or multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area. 

•  Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.  

ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of 
similar status.
