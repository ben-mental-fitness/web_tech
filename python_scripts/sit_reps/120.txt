Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  
Situation Report – 120 

Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 19 May 2020 

 
In his opening remarks at the World Health Assembly, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros declared: ‘We 
have come together as the nations of the world to confront the defining health crisis of our time.’ In 
concluding he asserted that the COVID-19 pandemic reminds us that we need a healthier, safer and 
fairer world with a stronger WHO to support this goal. 

Countries around the world have put in place a range of public health and social measures to suppress or 
stop community spread of COVID-19. WHO has published a document to provide an overview of public 
health and social measures, and to propose strategies to limit any possible harm resulting from these 
interventions.  

A new WHO report on the health behaviours of 11–15-year-olds in Europe reveals more adolescents 
have been reporting mental health concerns. The results were based on data between 2014 and 2018 
and provide a baseline against which future studies can measure the impact of COVID-19 on young 
people’s lives. 

The WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific has released a timeline outlining some of the key 
moments and actions to respond to COVID-19 in the Region.

Case definitions  
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.  

Definition of COVID-19 death 

COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible 
illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that 
cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery 
between the illness and death. 

Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is 
available here. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes 
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between 
information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources usi ng 
different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy 
and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, 
testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These 
factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case 
and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data at global level.   

The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of 
any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or 
area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and 
dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full 
agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region. 

[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security 
Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) 
have been aggregated for visualization purposes. 

Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions, unless stated 
otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic and 
repatriated cases.  

Other*: includes cases reported from an international conveyance (Diamond Princess).  

Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large 
numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative 
numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying 
when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to 
be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports 
will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data. 

Additional table notes 

i Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self -reporting. 
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new information becomes available, 
and are based on the highest category reported. Differing degrees of transmission may be present 
within countries/territories/areas. Categories:  

•  No cases: with no confirmed cases (not shown in table). 
•  Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected. 
•  Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common 

exposures. 

•  Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an 

assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to 
transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple 
unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area. 
•  Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.  

ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status. 

Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata 

•  Update 19 May 2020, Benin: A decrease of 210 cases has been reported due to pending PCR 

confirmation.  

•  Update 19 May 2020, São Tomé and Príncipe: A decrease of 4 cases has been reported to include 

PCR confirmed cases only.
