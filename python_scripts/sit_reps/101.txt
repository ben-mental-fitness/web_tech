HIGHLIGHTS 

 

•  WHO reminds health authorities to take specific steps to protect health care 
workers and communities during essential immunization activities during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. PAHO has published  an article on this, available here. 

•  WHO AMRO/PAHO Director, Dr Carissa F. Etienne, has urged for vaccination 
programs to continue during the COVID-19 pandemic: “If we fall behind on 
routine immunizations, particularly for children, we risk outbreaks, thus 
overwhelming hospitals and clinics with preventable diseases in addition to 
COVID-19.” Her full statement is available here. 

•  WHO/EURO Director, Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, called for transparent knowledge-

sharing, tailored support on the ground, and steadfast solidarity.  His 
statement is available here.  

•  WHO SEARO organized a meeting yesterday with vaccine manufacturers and 

national regulatory authorities to discuss  future COVID-19 vaccine 
manufacturing in the Region. An article on this is available here. 

•  WHO endeavours to ensure that all Member States have timely and accurate 
testing capacity for COVID-19. In the ‘Subject in Focus’ below, we describe 
some of the mechanisms WHO uses to support Member States.

SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Detection of disease – an update on laboratory  services for COVID-19 

Diagnostic laboratory testing is a cornerstone of the management of the COVID -19 pandemic. It allows for the 
detection of cases to inform care and for the isolation of infected individuals  to interrupt disease transmission. 
Confirmatory testing also enables the disease to be tracked in the community and for clusters of cases to be 
identified. WHO endeavours to ensure that all Member States have timely and accurate testing capacity for COVID-
19. This is done through several mechanisms. 

First, a reference laboratory network has been established across the 6 WHO regions, and recently expanded to 
include some two dozen laboratories with expertise in virology, diagnostics, sequencing, and often viral culture (see 
Figure 2 below). These laboratories act to support Member States that currently do not have testing capacity or need 
to get confirmation of their initial test results while building in-country capacity. These same laboratories serve as a 
valuable source of support for strategic planning for the WHO HQ team and provide guidance to the WHO Regional 
Office laboratory focal points as well. A shipment fund to allow transport of samples to WHO reference laboratories 
for confirmatory testing has been made available to cover transport costs.  

Second, working with WHO’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, surveillance testing for COVID -19 
disease has been established in clinics caring for patients with respiratory disease, giving an early hint to community 
penetration by COVID-19. 

Figure 2. WHO COVID-19 Reference Laboratory Network 

Third, since February 24th WHO has been providing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kits for COVID-19 directly to 
countries, offering Member States the capacity to detect cases or clusters before the disease gains a strong foothold. 
The scale of provision  of tests is set to rise to millions  of tests per month with the recent formation of the 
Diagnostics Consortium of donor and technical agencies convened by WHO to align and coordinate procurement of 
validated diagnostic test kits and related laboratory materials.

*Countries are arranged by official WHO regions, in descending order by the number of total confirmed cases. Overseas territories** are listed 
under the WHO region that administers them. 
†The designations employed and the presentation of the material in this publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on 
the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the  delimitation of its 
frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.  
‡Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.

§Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis and may 
be upgraded or downgraded as new information becomes available. Not all locations within a given count ry/territory/area are equally affected; 
countries/territories/areas  experiencing multiple  types  of  transmission are  classified in  the  highest  category  reported.  With in  a  given 
transmission category, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of 
cases, recency of cases, and other factors. 
Terms:  

-  No cases: Countries/territories/areas with no confirmed cases (not shown in table) 
-  Sporadic cases: Countries/territories/areas with one or more cases, imported or locally detected 
-  Clusters of cases: Countries/territories/areas experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common exposures  
-  Community transmission:  Countries/area/territories experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an assessment of 

factors including, but not limited to: 

-  Large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission chains 
-  Large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance 
-  Multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area 

 

**  “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution  1244 (1999). 
††  As the international conveyance (Diamond Princess) is no longer occupied, transmission classification cannot be applied.  
 
 
Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always 
reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed 
COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID -19 data using different inclusion criteria and different 
data cutoff times are to be expected. 
 
The number of cases for Lithuania has been adjusted retrospectively by Lithuanian authorities to include only those with positive polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) test results.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
 

• 

Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts 
and health care workers, preventing transmission  amplification events, and preventing further 
international spread*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 

• 
• 
•  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission  and infection, treatment 

options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 

•  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
•  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 

 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication. 

To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage. 

 
 
PREPAREDNESS AND  RESPONSE 
 
• 
•  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of COVID-19 outbreak, clinical management, infection prevention and 
control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus, risk communication and 
community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with COVID-19. 

•  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  

•  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 

informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.  

•  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 

epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection 
prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued  interim guidance for countries, which are 
updated regularly. 

•  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 

medicines and supplies  necessary to care for patients with COVID-19.  

•  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
•  WHO has published  an  updated recommendations for international traffic in relation to COVID-19 outbreak . 
•  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
•  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering free online courses to improve the 
response to health emergencies. COVID-19 resources are hosted on 2 learning channels: one for courses in 
official WHO languages here and a second for courses in additional national languages here.  

o  There are more than 1.5 million enrolments in the platform's courses to support the COVID-19 

response. Specifically, WHO has developed courses on the following topics: 

o  A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available 

in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Bengali, Hindi, Hungarian, Indian Sign Language, 
Indonesian, Macedonian, Persian, Portuguese, Serbian, Turkish and Vietnamese); 

o  Clinical care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) (available in English, French, Russian, 

Spanish, Indonesian, Portuguese and Vietnamese);  

o  Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases  – ePROTECT (available in 

o 

Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian and Portuguese);  
Infection Prevention and Control for COVID-19 (available 
in Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Macedonian, Portuguese, Ser
bian and Turkish); 

o  COVID-19 operational planning guidelines and partners platform to support country preparedness and 

response (available in Chinese, English, French, Russian, Indonesian and Portuguese); 

o  SARI treatment facility design (available in Arabic, English, Italian and Portuguese); 
o  An introduction to Go.Data – field data collection, chains of transmission and contact follow-up 

(available in English and coming soon in additional languages);  

o  How to put on and remove personal protective equipment (PPE) for COVID-19 (available in English and 

coming soon in additional languages); and  

o  Standard precautions for hand hygiene (available in  English and coming soon in additional languages). 

•  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data 
collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to 
characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of  COVID-19, help understand spread, severity, 
spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One 
such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and 
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)  infection”). The protocol is designed to 
gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 
COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection. 

 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE  FOR THE PUBLIC 
 
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is 
spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that 
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your 
risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your 
healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID -19 
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take 
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone). 
 
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the 
advice of WHO and guidance issued  by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection 
will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people, 
and those with pre-existing medical conditions  (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or 
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading). 
 
 
CASE  DEFINITIONS 
 
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
document which includes case definitions.  
  
For easy reference, case definitions  are included below.  

 
Suspect case 
A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness  (fever and at least one sign/symptom  of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, 

shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of 
COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset. 
OR 

B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness  AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID -19 

case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset; 
OR 

C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory illness  (fever and at least one sign/symptom  of respiratory disease, e.g., 
cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that 
fully explains the clinical presentation. 

 
Probable case  
A.  A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive. 

a. 

Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory. 

B.  A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason. 

OR 

 

Confirmed case  
A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. 

•  Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.  

 
 
Definition of contact 
A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days 
after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case: 

1.  Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes; 
2.  Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case; 
3.  Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal 

protective equipment1;  OR 

4.  Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments. 

 
Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days 
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation. 
 
Definition of COVID-19 death 
COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes  as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a 
probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to 
COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death.  
 
Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is available here.
