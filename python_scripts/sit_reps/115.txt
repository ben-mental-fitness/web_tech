 

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  
Situation Report – 115 

Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 14 May 2020 
 

Highlights 

Lesotho reported its first case of COVID-19. 

WHO has published an interim guidance document on Laboratory biosafety for testing of clinical 
specimens of patients that meet the case definition of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). 

WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros in his media briefing yesterday, highlighted the urgent need for all 
countries to invest in strong health systems and primary healthcare, as the best defence against 
outbreaks like COVID-19.  The World Health Statistics published by WHO,  show that people around the 
world are living longer and healthier lives overall with the biggest gains in low-income countries. 
However, the report also shows that the rate of progress is too slow to meet the Sustainable 
Development Goals and will be further thrown off track by COVID-19. 

WHO announced the launch of the WHO Academy and the WHO info mobile applications . The WHO 
Academy app is designed to support health workers during COVID-19 while the WHO Info app will 
provide the general public with real-time mobile access to the latest news and developments. 

In the light of overcrowding in many places of detention, which undermines hygiene, health, safety and 
human dignity, UNODC,WHO,UNAIDS and OHCHR released a joint statement on COVID-19 in prisons 
and other closed settings to urgently draw the attention of political leaders to the heightened 
vulnerability of prisoners and other people deprived of liberty due to COVID-19 pandemic.

Subject in Focus: Cleaning and Disinfection of Environmental Surfaces 

Like other coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped 
virus with an outer lipid envelope, which makes it more susceptible to disinfectants compared to non-
enveloped viruses such as rotavirus, norovirus, and poliovirus.1 SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted mainly through 
close contact and respiratory droplets, with possible airborne transmission in settings where procedures 
that can generate aerosol are performed.2 Although fomites and contaminated surfaces have yet to be 
conclusively linked to transmission of SARS-CoV-2, demonstration of surface contamination in healthcare 
settings3  and  experiences  with  surface  contamination  linked  to  subsequent  infection  transmission  in 
other coronaviruses, have informed the development of cleaning and disinfection recommendations to 
mitigate the potential of  fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare3 and non-healthcare settings.4 

In healthcare settings, environmental surfaces include the surfaces of furniture and other fixed items (e.g. 
tables, chairs, walls, light switches, computer peripherals) as well as the surfaces of non-critical medical 
equipment  (equipment  that  only  contacts  intact  skin,  such  as  blood  pressure  cuffs,  wheelchairs, 
incubators).6 These surfaces should be frequently cleaned with water and detergent and followed by 
application  of  a  disinfectant.  Among  the  most  common  disinfectants  used  which  have  been 
demonstrated to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 are: ethanol 70-90%; chlorine-based products (e.g., 
hypochlorite) at 0.1% (1000 ppm) for general environmental disinfection or 0.5% (5000 ppm) for blood 
and body fluids large spills; or hydrogen peroxide >0.5%.5- 6 The minimal time recommended of exposition 
to the surface for these disinfectants is one minute1 or according to the manufacturer instructions. In 
non-healthcare settings, environmental surfaces include furniture and other fixed items, such as counter 
tops, stairway rails, as well as floors and walls. Disinfectants should be applied to high touch surfaces to 
reduce potential SARS-CoV-2 contamination in community settings where the risk of contamination is 
unknown  (e.g.  gyms,  offices,  restaurants,  accommodation  sector)  as  well  as  in  households  and  non-
traditional facilities where individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 disease are accommodated.  

In indoor spaces, routine application of disinfectants to environmental surfaces via spraying or fogging 
(also known as fumigation or misting) is not recommended. Spraying environmental surfaces in both 
health care and non-healthcare settings (e.g. patient households) with disinfectants will not be effective 
and may pose harm to individuals.7-10 If disinfectants are to be applied, manual surface cleaning with 
detergent and water using applied friction (e.g. brushing, scrubbing) must be performed first to ensure 
physical  removal  of  organic  materials,  followed  by  use  of  a  cloth  or  wipe  which  is  soaked  in  the 
disinfectant. 

Spraying or fumigation of outdoor spaces (such as streets, sidewalks, walkways or marketplaces), is not 
recommended to remove or inactivate SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens. Streets and sidewalks are not 
considered as routes of infection for COVID-19. Moreover, disinfectants are inactivated by dirt and debris, 
and it is not feasible to manually clean and remove all organic matter from such spaces. Even in the 
absence of organic matter, chemical spraying is unlikely to adequately cover all surfaces for the duration 
of the required contact time to inactivate pathogens.  

Spraying individuals with disinfectants (such as in a tunnel, cabinet, or chamber) is not recommended 
under any circumstances. This practice could be physically and psychologically harmful and would not 
reduce an infected person’s ability to spread the virus through droplets or contact. The toxic effect of 
spraying with chemicals such as chlorine on individuals can lead to eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm 
due to inhalation, and potentially gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting.9, 11  

The role of fomites as a mode of transmission of COVID-19 in general, and the necessity of disinfection 
practices to mitigate transmission of the virus outside of healthcare environments is currently unknown. 
However, infection prevention and control principles designed to mitigate the spread of pathogens in 
health  settings,  including  cleaning  and  disinfection  practices,  have  been  widely  adapted  in  current 
guidance  to  be  applied  in  non-healthcare  setting  environments.12-21  In  all  settings,  including  settings 
where resource limitations may not permit cleaning and disinfection to be performed regularly, frequent 
hand washing and avoiding touching of the face should be considered the primary prevention approach 
to mitigate the suspected mode of transmission associated with surface contamination.22

Case definitions  
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.  

Definition of COVID-19 death 

COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically 
compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative 
cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period 
of complete recovery between the illness and death. 

Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is 
available here. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes 
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected 
between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other 
sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to 
ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case 
detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between 
countries/territories/areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented with 
variable underestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data 
at global level.   

The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of 
any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or 
area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and 
dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full 
agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region. 

[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security 
Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 
1999) have been aggregated for visualization purposes. 

Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions unless stated 
otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic 
and repatriated cases.  

Other*: includes cases reported under the international conveyance (Diamond Princess).  

Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large 
numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative 
numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in 
identifying when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available that allow the 
subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior 
situation reports will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data. 

Additional table notes 

i Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. 
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new information becomes 
available, and are based on the highest category reported. Differing degrees of transmission may be 
present within countries/territories/areas. Categories:  

•  No cases: with no confirmed cases (not shown in table). 
•  Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected. 
•  Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common 

exposures. 

•  Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through 
an assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to 
transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple 
unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area. 
•  Pending: transmission classification not been reported to WHO.  

ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar 
status. 

Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata 

No major updates.
