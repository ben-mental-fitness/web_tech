Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)  
Situation Report – 122 

Data as received by WHO from national authorities by 10:00 CEST, 21 May 2020 

 

Highlights 

The WHO World Health Assembly has ended with a global commitment to the COVID-19 response. 
Delegates adopted a landmark resolution to bring the world together to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. 

WHO has been supporting Somalia since the beginning of this outbreak to enhance its infection control 
measures, testing capacities, and case management. In particular, training  has been provided for the 
healthcare workers of the De-Martino hospital and 13 other isolation centres across the country, which 
have also received medical supplies  and budget support for salaries. However, so far, only 26% of WHO’s 
urgent appeal of US$ 21.95 million for emergency response to COVID-19 in Somalia has been funded. 

The World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development, celebrated every year on 21 May, is an 
opportunity to celebrate not only the richness of the world’s cultures, but also the importance of cultural 
competency and intercultural dialogue within healthcare systems.  It also reminds us that public health 
efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic require a whole-of-society approach and must include vulnerable 
populations such as refugees and migrants in national plans and strategies.

Case definitions  
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19) document which includes surveillance definitions.  

Definition of COVID-19 death 

COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible 
illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that 
cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery 
between the illness and death. 

Further guidance for certification and classification (coding) of COVID-19 as cause of death is 
available here. 
 

 

 

Annex 1: Data, table and figure notes 
Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented. Differences are to be expected between 
information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using 
different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy 
and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. Case detection, definitions, 
testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. These 
factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case 
and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data at global level.   

The designations employed, and the presentation of these materials do not imply the expression of 
any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory or 
area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and 
dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full 
agreement. Countries, territories and areas are arranged under the administering WHO region. 

The mention of specific companies or of certain manufacturers’ products does not imply that they are 
endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature that are not 
mentioned. Errors and omissions excepted, the names of proprietary products are distinguished by 
initial capital letters. 

[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security 
Council resolution 1244 (1999). In the map, number of cases of Serbia and Kosovo (UNSCR 1244, 1999) 
have been aggregated for visualization purposes. 

Counts reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based on WHO case definitions, unless stated 
otherwise (see Country, territory, or area-specific updates and errata), and include both domestic and 
repatriated cases.  

Other*: includes cases reported from an international conveyance (Diamond Princess).  

Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large 
numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, WHO will now display such data as negative 
numbers in the “new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid readers in identifying 
when such adjustments occur. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to 
be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. Prior situation reports 
will not be edited; see covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data. 

Additional table notes 

i Transmission classification is based on a process of country/territory/area self-reporting. 
Classifications are reviewed on a weekly basis, may be revised as new information becomes available, 
and are based on the highest category reported. Differing degrees of transmission may be present 
within countries/territories/areas. Categories:  

•  No cases: with no confirmed cases  
•  Sporadic cases: with one or more cases, imported or locally detected. 
•  Clusters of cases: experiencing cases, clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common 

exposures. 

•  Community transmission: experiencing larger outbreaks of local transmission defined through an 

assessment of factors including, but not limited to: large numbers of cases not linkable to 
transmission chains; large numbers of cases from sentinel lab surveillance; and/or multiple 
unrelated clusters in several areas of the country/territory/area. 
•  Pending: transmission classification has not been reported to WHO.  

ii “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status.

•  Update 21 May 2020, United Kingdom: Counts adjusted retrospectively by national authorities 

due to data reclassification: 525 cases were excluded.
