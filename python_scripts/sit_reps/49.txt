SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Operations Supply and Logistics (OSL) 
 
WHO Operations Supply and Logistics (OSL) continues to support COVID-19 emergency operations where global 
demand for critical items continues to outpace global supply.  
 
WHO continues to highlight the need for prioritization of personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies for frontline 
healthcare workers.  To help make supplies available, OSL and partners in the Pandemic Supply Chain Network 
(PSCN) have agreed on mechanisms to secure global warehousing for donated COVID-19 emergency supplies.  
 
OSL are also working with ventilator and respirator equipment manufacturers to develop technical guidance for 
oxygen therapy and related equipment in the context of COVID-19. 
 
Together with WFP, UNICEF and the World Bank, OSL continues to work on a proposal for a Supply Chain 
Coordination Cell to support the UN Crisis Management Team with improved information and coordination to 
support strategic guidance, operational decision-making, and overall monitoring.   
 
Since the beginning of the outbreak, OSL have shipped more than 584,000 surgical masks, 47,000 N95 masks, 
620,000 gloves, 72,000 gowns and 11,000 goggles to 57 countries. 
 
OSL have also shipped laboratory tests to more than 120 countries to facilitate COVID-19 testing, 
 
In cooperation with the International Humanitarian City (IHC) in Dubai and with aircraft provided by the government 
of the UAE, OSL organized a flight from Dubai to Iran on March 2, to support the first delivery of emergency PPE and 
lab tests. 
 
In collaboration with WHO Health Operations, an Intensive Care Unit-assessment form is being finalized in order to 
facilitate independent assessment of ICUs and identify existing supplies to support COVID-19 response activities.

‡Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.  
§Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become 
available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is 
evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within 
categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and 
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by 
increasing positive tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established laboratories). 
Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location. 
Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.   
Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases. 
Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined) 

** “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status 
 
Erratum: Total cases, and new cases for Faroe Islands have been corrected.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
 

• 

Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts 
and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further 
international spread*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 

• 
• 
•  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 

options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 

•  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
•  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 

 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
 
• 
•  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 

•  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  

•  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 

informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 

•  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 

epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection 
prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are 
updated regularly. 

•  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 

medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  

•  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
•  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 

coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 

•  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
•  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the 

response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online 
courses on the following topics:  A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel 
coronaviruses (available in Arabic, English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian);  Critical Care of 
Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English and French); Health and safety briefing for respiratory 
diseases - ePROTECT (available in English, French, and Russian); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel 
Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in English and Russian);  and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and 
COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response. 

•  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data 
collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to 
characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity, 
spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One 
such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and 
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to 
gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 
COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection. 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
 
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is 
spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that 
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your 
risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your 
healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19 
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take 
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone). 
 
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the 
advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection 
will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people, 
and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or 
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading). 
 
 
CASE DEFINITIONS 
 
WHO periodically updates the  Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
document which includes case definitions.  
  
For easy reference, case definitions are included below.  
 
Suspect case 

A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g., 

cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a 
history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation 
report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset. 

OR 
B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-

19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; 

OR 
C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease 
(e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization AND with no other etiology that fully explains 
the clinical presentation. 

 
Probable case  
A suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive.  

• 

Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory 

 
Confirmed case  
A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.
