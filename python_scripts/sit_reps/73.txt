HIGHLIGHTS 
 

hours. 

•  No new countries/territories/areas reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 

•  WHO has released a Medical Product Alert that warns consumers, healthcare 
professionals, and health authorities against a growing number of falsified 
medical products that claim to prevent, detect, treat or cure COVID-19. Find 
more here. 

•  WHO is working with Iraq to increase surveillance and response capacities. 
WHO has printed hundreds  of thousands of prevention and transmission 
control messages, taken mobile health teams to the streets, and delivered 
urgent consignments of personal protective equipment (PPE) and laboratory 
test kits. More information can be found here. 

•  WHO has been working with governments and partners around the world, 

across many areas of activity: conducting needs assessments, providing hand 
sanitizers and masks for health professionals, providing training on the clinical 
management of patients with COVID-19, collaborating with local media 
outlets and conducting awareness raising activities, delivering test kits, 
conducting simulation exercises, and shipping personal protective equipment 
through WHO logistical hubs. As an example, WHO EURO has released a photo 
story of WHO’s activities in Kyrgyzstan, available here. 

•  Our understanding of the transmission of COVID-19 virus continues to 

improve with the evolution of the outbreak. For more, see ‘Subject in Focus’. 

• 

insights into the virus. For more details, please see ‘Subject in Focus’.

SUBJECT IN FOCUS: The routes of transmission  from COVID-19  patients 
 
As  the  COVID-19  outbreak  continues  to  evolve,  we  are  learning  more  about  this  new  virus  every  day.  Here  we 
summarize what has been reported about transmission of the COVID-19 virus, and provide a brief overview of available 
evidence on transmission from symptomatic, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic people infected with COVID-19.  
 
Symptomatic transmission 
By way of definition, a symptomatic COVID-19 case is a case who has developed signs and symptoms compatible with 
COVID-19 virus infection.  Symptomatic transmission refers to transmission from a person while they are experiencing 
symptoms.  
 
Data from published epidemiology and virologic studies provide evidence that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted from 
symptomatic people to others who are in close contact through respiratory droplets,  by direct contact with infected 
persons, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. 1-7 This is supported by detailed experiences shared by 
technical partners via WHO global expert networks, and reports and presentations by Ministries of Health.  
 
Data from  clinical  and  virologic  studies  that  have  collected  repeated biological  samples  from  confirmed  patients 
provide evidence that shedding of the COVID-19 virus is highest in upper respiratory tract (nose and throat) early in 
the course of the disease.8-11 That is, within the first 3 days from onset  of symptoms. 10-11  Preliminary data suggests 
that people may be more contagious around the time of symptom onset  as compared to later on in the disease.  
 
Pre-symptomatic transmission 
The  incubation  period  for  COVID-19,  which  is  the  time  between  exposure  to  the  virus  (becoming  infected)  and 
symptom  onset, is  on average 5-6 days, however can be up  to 14 days. During this period, also known  as the “pre-
symptomatic” period, some infected persons can be contagious. Therefore, transmission from a pre-symptomatic case 
can occur before symptom onset.  
 
In a small number of case reports and studies, pre-symptomatic transmission  has been documented through contact 
tracing efforts and enhanced investigation of clusters of confirmed cases. 12-17 This is supported by data suggesting that 
some people can test positive  for COVID-19 from 1-3 days before they develop symptoms.6,16 Thus, it is possible  that 
people  infected  with  COVID-19 could  transmit the  virus  before  significant  symptoms  develop.  It  is  important  to 
recognize that pre-symptomatic transmission  still  requires the virus  to be spread via infectious  droplets or  through 
touching contaminated surfaces.  
 
Asymptomatic transmission 
An asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed  case is  a person  infected with COVID-19 who  does  not develop  symptoms. 
Asymptomatic transmission refers to transmission of the virus from a person, who does not develop symptoms. 
 
There are few  reports of  laboratory-confirmed  cases who  are truly  asymptomatic, and  to date, there has been  no 
documented asymptomatic transmission. This does not exclude the possibility  that it may occur. Asymptomatic cases 
have been reported as part of contact tracing efforts in some countries.   
 
WHO regularly monitors all emerging evidence about this critical topic and will provide an update as more information 
becomes available.

‡Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.  
§Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as addi tional data become 
available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing multiple types of  transmission  are classified in the highest category for  which  there is 
evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted t hat even within 
categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and 
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected. 
Terms:

Community  transmission  is evidenced by the inability  to relate confirmed  cases through  chains of transmission  for  a large number  of cases, or by 
increasing positive  tests through  sentinel  samples (routine  systematic testing of respiratory  samples from established  labora tories). 
Local transmission  indicates locations  where the source  of infection  is within  the reporting  location. 
Imported cases only indicates locations  where all cases have been acquired outside  the location  of reporting.    
Under investigation  indicates locations  where type of transmission  has not been determined  for  any cases. 
Interrupted  transmission  indicates locations  where interruption  of transmission  has been demonstrated  (details to be determined) 

**  “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status 
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (19 99). 
 
Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always 
reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed 
COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID -19 data using different inclusion criteria and different 
data cutoff times are to be expected. 
 
Erratum: Deaths for Syrian Arab Republic has been revised. Cases and new cases for Kuwait have been revised.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
 

• 

Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts 
and health care workers, preventing transmission  amplification events, and preventing further 
international spread*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 

• 
• 
•  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission  and infection, treatment 

options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 

•  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
•  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 

 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication.

PREPAREDNESS AND  RESPONSE 
 
• 
•  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 

•  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  

•  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 

informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.  

•  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 

epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection 
prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued  interim guidance for countries, which are 
updated regularly. 

•  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 

medicines and supplies  necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  

•  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
•  WHO has published  an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 

coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 

•  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
•  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the 
response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here and courses in additional national 
languages here.  Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  

o  A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses  (available in 

Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Indian Sign Language, Persian, Portuguese, 
Serbian and Turkish); 

o  Clinical care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, Indonesian 

and Vietnamese);  

o  Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases  - ePROTECT (available in Chinese, English, French, 

o 

Russian, Spanish, Indonesian and Portuguese);  
Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in Chinese, English, French, 
Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Serbian); and 

o  COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country 
preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon  in additional languages). 

•  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data 
collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to 
characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity, 
spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One 
such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and 
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)  infection”). The protocol is designed to 
gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 
COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection. 

 
 
 

 

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE  FOR THE PUBLIC 
 
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is 
spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that 
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your 
risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your 
healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID -19 
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take 
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone). 
 
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the 
advice of WHO and guidance issued  by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection 
will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people, 
and those with pre-existing medical conditions  (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or 
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading). 
 
 
CASE  DEFINITIONS 
 
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
document which includes case definitions.  
  
For easy reference, case definitions  are included below.  
 
Suspect case 
A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness  (fever and at least one sign/symptom  of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, 

shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of 
COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset. 
OR 

B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness  AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID -19 

case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset; 
OR 

C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory illness  (fever and at least one sign/symptom  of respiratory disease, e.g., 

cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that 
fully explains the clinical presentation. 

 
Probable case  
A.  A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive. 

a. 

Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory. 

B.  A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason. 

OR 

 

Confirmed case  
A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. 

•  Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.  

 
 
 
Definition of contact 
A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days 

after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case: 

1.  Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes; 
2.  Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case; 
3.  Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal 

protective equipment1;  OR 

4.  Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments. 

 
Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days 
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.
