HIGHLIGHTS 
 

•  One  new  country/territory/area reported cases  of  COVID-19  in  the past  24 

hours: São Tomé and Príncipe. 

•  Today, 7 April, marks World Health Day and this year WHO pays tribute to the 
incredible contribution of all health workers, especially nurses and midwives.  
Nurses  are  the  largest  component  of  the  health  workforce  and  play  a 
fundamental  role  in  combatting  COVID-19  and  achieving  Universal  Health 
Coverage and  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  WHO  has  published  the 
first-ever report on the state of the world’s nursing workforce, available here. 
It renews calls on governments to invest in nurses. 

•  WHO,  Lady  Gaga and  Global  Citizen  have  announced  a  concert  to  air  on 
Saturday, 18 April  2020  titled 'One  World:  Together at home'.  This  globally 
televised and streamed special will highlight unity among all people affected 
by COVID-19, celebrate the brave healthcare workers doing life-saving work, 
and raise funds for the response. More information is available here. 

•  WHO  Director-General  Dr  Tedros,  in  a  press  conference  held  yesterday, 
reiterated concerns regarding the shortage of medical masks and other PPE 
and reminded people that masks should  be used as part of a comprehensive 
package of interventions. WHO has released guidance on the use of masks in 
communities, during home care, and in healthcare settings that can be found 
here; further advice for the public can be found here. 

•  WHO is improving supply  networks and logistics in clinical environments, and 
sending equipment and testing kits worldwide. See ‘Subject in Focus’ below.

SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Supporting countries with COVID-19 supplies and logistical  needs 

Improving supply networks 

Significant efforts are underway to improve access to items essential for the COVID-19 emergency response. 
Through the continued efforts of WHO and the Pandemic Supply  Chain Network (PSCN), the personal protective 
equipment (PPE) manufacturing market is beginning to open, however demand continues to outstrip available 
supply.  

The Operations Support and Logistics (OSL) unit at WHO is working to convene meetings with key stakeholders 
including oxygen, ventilator and concentrator manufacturers and producers of associated ancillary equipment. In 
addition to securing the appropriate equipment for those countries at most risk or most vulnerable, WHO and the 
PSCN is working with the World Bank and other UN agencies to ensure that the infrastructure, technical guidance 
and other operational guidance is available.   

Through collaboration with the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), OSL’s COVID -19 Essential Supplies  Forecasting 
Tool has been finalized. Output from the model is being shared with partners and is assisting both procurement 
agencies and suppliers in understanding national requirements of key supplies. 

Sending personal protective equipment and testing kits 

Since the beginning of the outbreak, OSL has shipped more than 900 000 surgical masks, 62 000 N95 masks, 1 million 
gloves, 115 000 gowns, 17 000 goggles and 34 000 face shields to 133 countries. OSL has also shipped COVID-19 
testing kits to 126 countries. 

Strengthening health logistics in clinical environments 

OSL has also launched and supported the COVID-19 Health Logistics Project, establishing direct technical support to 
hospitals to re-design their facilities into infectious disease treatment units.  This support has included improving 
patient and healthcare worker flow, promoting rational use of PPE, and minimizing nosocomial  transmission.  

To achieve these aims, OSL has established the Health Logistics Technical Network (HLTN). The network is composed 
of recognized universities, humanitarian institutions and international NGOs focused on technical interventions. A 
WHO-based helpdesk  serves as a centralized resource to answer technical questions, verify and provide inputs on 
COVID-19 facility layouts, troubleshoot problems, and facilitate solutions to problems while supporting experts in the 
field. Helpdesk support has been successfully  provided in Australia for the Canberra Hospital Campus SARI layout, 
and additional support has been requested from Italy and France.

§Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as addi tional data become

evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted t hat even within 
categories, different countries/territories/areas may have di ffering degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and 
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Community  transmission  is evidenced by the inability  to relate confirmed  cases through  chains of transmission  for  a large number  of cases, or by 
increasing positive  tests through  sentinel  samples (routine  systematic testing of respiratory  samples from established  labora tories). 
Local transmission  indicates locations  where the source  of infection  is within  the reporting  location. 
Imported cases only indicates locations  where all cases have been acquired outside  the location  of reporting.    
Under investigation  indicates locations  where type of transmission  has not been determined  for  any cases. 
Interrupted  transmission  indicates locations  where interruption  of transmission  has been demonstrated  (details to be determined) 

**  “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status  
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (19 99). 
 
Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always 
reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed 
COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID -19 data using different inclusion criteria and different 
data cutoff times are to be expected. 
 
New countries/territories/areas are shown in red.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
 

• 

Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts 
and health care workers, preventing transmission  amplification events, and preventing further 
international spread*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;  
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 

• 
• 
•  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission  and infection, treatment 

options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 

•  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
•  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 

 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication.

PREPAREDNESS AND  RESPONSE 
 
• 
•  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 

•  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  

•  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 

informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.  

•  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 

epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection 
prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued  interim guidance for countries, which are 
updated regularly. 

•  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 

medicines and supplies  necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  

•  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
•  WHO has published  an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 

coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 

•  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
•  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the 
response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here and courses in additional national 
languages here.  Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  

o  A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in 

Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Indian Sign Language, Persian, Portuguese, 
Serbian and Turkish); 

o  Clinical care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, Indonesian 

and Vietnamese);  

o  Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases  - ePROTECT (available in Chinese, English, French, 

o 

Russian, Spanish, Indonesian and Portuguese);  
Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in Chinese, English, French, 
Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Serbian); and 

o  COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country 
preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon  in additional languages).  

•  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data 
collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to 
characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity, 
spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One 
such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and 
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)  infection”). The protocol is designed to 
gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 
COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection. 

 
 
 

 

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE  FOR THE PUBLIC 
 
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is 
spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that 
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your 
risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your 
healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19 
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take 
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone). 
 
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the 
advice of WHO and guidance issued  by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection 
will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people, 
and those with pre-existing medical conditions  (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or 
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading). 
 
 
CASE  DEFINITIONS 
 
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
document which includes case definitions.  
  
For easy reference, case definitions  are included below.  
 
Suspect case 
A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness  (fever and at least one sign/symptom  of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, 

shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of 
COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset. 
OR 

B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness  AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID -19 

case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset; 
OR 

C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory illness  (fever and at least one sign/symptom  of respiratory disease, e.g., 

cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis  that 
fully explains the clinical presentation. 

 
Probable case  
A.  A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive. 

a. 

Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory. 

B.  A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason. 

OR 

 

Confirmed case  
A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. 

•  Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.  

 
 
 
Definition of contact 
A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days 

after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case: 

1.  Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes; 
2.  Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case; 
3.  Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal 

protective equipment1;  OR 

4.  Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments. 

 
Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days 
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.
