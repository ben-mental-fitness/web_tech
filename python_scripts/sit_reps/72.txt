Situation Report – 72 

Data as reported by national authorities by 10:00 CET 1 April 2020  

 

 

 

HIGHLIGHTS 
 

•  Three new countries/territories/areas reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 

24 hours: Botswana, Burundi, and Sierra Leone. 

•  WHO has released a scientific brief on the off-label use of medicines for 
COVID-19. A number of medicines have been suggested as potential 
investigational therapies, many of which are now being or will soon be studied 
in clinical trials, including the SOLIDARITY trial co-sponsored by WHO and 
participating countries. More information can be found here. 

•  WHO  recognizes  the  importance  of  addressing  the  needs  of  refugees  and 
migrants when preparing for or responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO 
European  Region  has  released  a  guidance  document  to  assist  healthcare 
working with refugees and migrants. More information can be found here. 

•  At a press briefing, yesterday, PAHO Director Dr. Carissa Etienne stressed that 
countries of the Americas must act now to slow the spread of COVID-19. WHO 
encourages countries to prepare hospitals and health facilities, protect their 
health personnel, and decide what social distancing measures need to be 
implemented and for how long, among other actions. Find more here. 

•  Public health and social measures to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19 
must be implemented with the full engagement of all members of society. 
WHO has described four levels of COVID-19 transmission with varying public 
health and social measures depending on the local evolution of the COVID-19 
pandemic. For more details, please see ‘Subject in Focus’.

SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Public Health and Social Measures for the COVID-19 Pandemic 
 
The purpose of this note is to outline public health and social measures useful for slowing or stopping the spread of 
COVID-19 at national or community level. Guidance for case finding and management, personal and environmental 
measures, travel measures, and mass gatherings is available on the WHO website available here. 
 
Public health and social measures are measures or actions by individuals, institutions, communities, local and 
national governments and international bodies to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19. These measures to reduce 
transmission of COVID-19 include individual and environmental measures, detecting and isolating cases, contact-
tracing and quarantine, social and physical distancing measures including for mass gatherings, international travel 
measures, and vaccines and treatments. While vaccines and specific medications are not yet available for COVID-19, 
other public health and social measures play an essential role in reducing the number of infections and saving lives.   
 
Social and physical distancing measures aim to slow the spread of disease by stopping chains of transmission of 
COVID-19 and preventing new ones from appearing. These measures secure physical distance between people (of at 
least one metre), and reduce contact with contaminated surfaces, while encouraging and sustaining virtual social 
connection within families and communities. Measures for the general public include introducing flexible work 
arrangements such as teleworking, distance learning, reducing and avoiding crowding, closure of non-essential 
facilities and services, shielding and protection for vulnerable groups, local or national movement restrictions and 
staying-at home measures, and coordinated reorganization of health care and social services networks to protect 
hospitals. The measures are used in conjunction with individual protective measures against COVID-19 such as 
frequent hand washing and cough etiquette.  
 
All public health measures to stop disease spread can be balanced with adaptive strategies to encourage community 
resilience and social connection, protect incomes and secure the food supply. Countries should balance the possible 
benefits and negative consequences of each intervention and deploy strategies to encourage community 
engagement, gain trust and limit social or economic harm. There are many strategies that can support community 
resilience and mental health, protect access to essential goods and services, and limit the economic impact of stay-
at-home measures where these are deemed necessary. For example, organizing work-sites to ensure physical 
distance between persons, such as staggering shifts over time, or converting on-site service to home delivery may 
help to keep more businesses open. Tele-working and tele-schooling strategies in different contexts demonstrate 
innovation and the role of technology in supporting business continuity and sustaining social connection within 
families and communities. In general, implementation of distancing measures should also aim to sustain personal 
and professional community connections by virtual means and technology, including widely accessible means such 
as radio and mobile phones. 
 
Alongside all these measures remains there is the critical to test all suspected cases of COVID-19 wherever possible, 
promptly isolate cases, trace contacts to the widest extent possible, and ensure quarantine of contacts for the 
duration of the incubation period. This goes for any context or level of spread of the pandemic in a country, in order 
to deepen the benefits of social measures. Social measures should make the task of contact tracing much easier as 
the number of contacts rapidly dwindles and eventually the number of cases declines as well. As social measures are 
lifted, it is essential to continue to strengthen case-finding, isolation for COVID-19 cases and quarantine of contacts, 
in order to respond to resurgent or imported cases. Coordinated reorganization of health and social services is 
essential to assess and test persons rapidly, treat patients effectively, and protect hospitals and health personnel.   
 
WHO has described four levels of COVID-19 transmission. These are countries or local areas with: 1. No cases 
reported. 2. Sporadic cases. 3. Clusters of cases (grouped in place and time), or 4. Community transmission. 
Countries are putting in place a range of public health and social measures in different combinations and at varying 
times in the local evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. The alignment of public health measures to levels of 
transmission in a community is not fixed in stone. Countries may wish to specify which measures are to be taken at 
each level and review the situation regularly. A package of measures may be applied at local, regional or national 
level and adjusted as needed, considering aspects such as culture, living environments, terrain and access to needed 
resources. Essential services should remain operational and governments should put in place social and economic 
policies to limit the longer term economic impact, support community resilience and enable rapid recovery. Most 
importantly, the ultimate aim is to ‘walk back’ community transmission to clusters, sporadic cases, and down to no 
cases at all, and to begin gradually lifting social measures as soon as it is safe to do so. Guidance for lifting measures 

is being developed.  
 
To be effective, public health measures must be implemented with the full engagement of all members of society, 
including communities and professional groups. All measures should be accompanied with clear, accessible and 
regular risk communication to explain the response strategy and enable people to make informed decisions to 
protect themselves and help achieve the public health goal of ending the outbreak.  
 
A table summarizing public health and social measures to support control of COVID-19 will be available shortly at 
www.who.int/epi-win.

‡Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.  
§Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become 
available.  Countries/territories/areas  experiencing  multiple  types  of  transmission  are  classified  in  the  highest  category  for  which  there  is 
evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within 
categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and 
other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected. 
Terms:  

-

Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by 
increasing positive tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established laboratories). 
Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location. 
Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.   
Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases. 
Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined) 

** “Territories” include territories, areas, overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar status 
[1] All references to Kosovo should be understood to be in the context of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). 
 
Due to differences in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation, and reporting delays, the number of new cases may not always 
reflect the exact difference between yesterday’s and today’s totals. WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed 
COVID-19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID-19 data using different inclusion criteria and different 
data cutoff times are to be expected. 
 
 
 
New countries/territories/areas are shown in red.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
 
WHO’s strategic objectives for this response are to: 
 

• 

Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts 
and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further 
international spread*;  
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; 

• 
• 
•  Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 

options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; 

•  Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; 
•  Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. 

 
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and 
risk communication.

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE 
 
• 
•  WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, 
infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement and Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 

•  WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the IATA webpage.  

•  WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Member States where cases have been reported. WHO is also 

informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested. 

•  WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 

epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection 
prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are 
updated regularly. 

•  WHO has prepared a disease commodity package that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 

medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.  

•  WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans. 
•  WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 

coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 

•  WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. 
•  OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the 
response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here and courses in additional national 
languages here.  Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:  

o  A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in 

Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Indian Sign Language, Persian, Portuguese, 
Serbian and Turkish); 

o  Clinical care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, Indonesian 

and Vietnamese);  

o  Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases - ePROTECT (available in Chinese, English, French, 

o 

Russian, Spanish, Indonesian and Portuguese);  
Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in Chinese, English, French, 
Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Serbian); and 

o  COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country 
preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages). 

•  WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data 
collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to 
characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19, help understand spread, severity, 
spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing and isolation. Several protocols are available here. One 
such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the “First Few X (FFX) Cases and 
contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection”). The protocol is designed to 
gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 
COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection. 

 
 
 

 

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLIC 
 
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is 
spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that 
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your 
risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your 
healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19 
and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take 
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone). 
 
If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the 
advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection 
will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people, 
and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or 
diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading). 
 
 
CASE DEFINITIONS 
 
WHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
document which includes case definitions.  
  
For easy reference, case definitions are included below.  
 
Suspect case 
A.  A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, 
shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of 
COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset. 
OR 

B.  A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 

case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset; 
OR 

C.  A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., 

cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that 
fully explains the clinical presentation. 

 
Probable case  
A.  A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive. 

a. 

Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory. 

B.  A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason. 

OR 

 

Confirmed case  
A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. 

•  Technical guidance for laboratory testing can be found here.  

 
 
 
Definition of contact 
A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days 

after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case: 

1.  Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes; 
2.  Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case; 
3.  Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal 

protective equipment1;  OR 

4.  Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments. 

 
Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days 
after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.
